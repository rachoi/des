                1)
                I might be color blind but I think that I saw that the 2020 section was not lighting up when the user was on the 2020 section. I will have to double check the code on the things checking for the position of the screen. Additionally, I was suggested to add some padding to the navigation container and to align the 2018 containers to the left so it matches the other containers. (I’ve been suggested this idea before, just haven’t implemented it yet because it wasn’t a huge priority)

            2)
            Progress bar works fine except for the fact that the bottom portion does not fill completely. Adjust the number of words per line so the sections aren’t stretched as much and are easier to read. Maybe change from yellow because it’s kind of hard to see with white as a background. Possible functionality change is that when you are going through the page, change circle colors as well. Ie. unvisited = white, visited = yellow. Could also make it so the image header can redirect to the default position of the page (so at the top).
            </p>

            <p>
            3)
            Labels for the images need to be closer to the images so it looks like it belongs there.
            Make font size smaller potentially as well.
            Add links to the dates in sections to redirect to start of it as well (I guess as a shortcut)

            Overall, just design changes/suggestions.

            <p>
            I implemented the idea of changing the circle colors to better match a look of check points. I also messed around with the code for the progress bar and it looks like it might've fixed the issue of not lighting up 2020 and not completely filling. I also fixed the labeling to improve readibility.
