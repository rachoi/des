                        <p> The article mentioned a lot of different good practices people should follow when creating a form design for their website. It talked a lot about visual cues that help the user when they are filling out the form.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="statement"> 
                        <p> The first thing it mentions is to have the input fields on one column and to not have too many input fields, but if unavoidable, use multi-step forms.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="statement"> 
                        <p> It also mentions that it is good practice to label what the input is supposed to be, and provide some examples to what it should be outside of the input field.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="statement" id="footer"> 
                        <p> The gist of the article was to make it so we provide the user with visuals that help them figure out what to do/whether things were successful, etc.</p>

                    <h1 class="statement-header"> Overlays </h1>

                    <div class="statement"> 
                        <p> The article talking about overlays and models talks about the different ways to help the user understand what is going on and what the UI components are doing.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="statement"> 
                        <p> For example, we should give a good description of what the overlay is expecting (what we want the user to do and where to do it ie. click here to submit, etc).</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="statement"> 
                        <p> The article also talked about the best practices when using a model. For example, it should always be triggered by a button rather than popping up on launch.</p>

                    <div class="statement"> 
                        <p> I think the main point of the article was that people all come up with different interpretations of what they see. </p>

                    <div class="statement"> 
                        <p> One person might think one thing is happening in an image, but another person might have understood things differently and think something else is happening. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="statement"> 
                        <p> The author to also spend a decent time talking about paying attention to specific details of images to come up with your own understanding of what is going on, and then sharing it with others while explaining how you came to those conclusions. To be honest, this is kind of like a tutorial on how to develop critical thinking skills.</p>
