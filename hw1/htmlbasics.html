        <h1>HTML Basics</h1>

        <p>Notice that if you create a new file in Visual Studio Code, save the file with a .html extension, you can
            type an exclaimation point (!) then press tab on your keyboard and you will get all the boiler plate html
            structure you need.</p>

        <h2>Other Things to Notice</h2>

        <p>Notice the inclusion of a language attribute on the html tag. This is a best practice. Please include it.</p>

        <p>The title of the document inside the head shows up on the browser tab. It is important. Please be sure to set
            it to something appropriate on all your HTML files.</p>

        <p>Notice proper indenting. This is a simple document, so there isn't a lot to indent. As your documents begin
            to have more complex structure, it is important that you get indenting right, as it will make your documents
            more readable (in code view) and maintainable. You can indent blocks of code by selecting them and either
            pressing tab, or shift tab (to exdent them).</p>

        <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>

        <p>The idea of semantic HTML is that the structure of content in your HTML documents is appropriate to the
            meaning of that content. This content is in a paragraph, because this is a paragraph. In CSS you can make
            this paragraph look any way you want, but it will still be a paragraph and hold a paragraph of text.</p>

        <p>Notice the use of the headings. You should never skip heading levels in your HTML documents. So if you use an
            h3 heading level, there should be a higher level h2 and h1 on the page.</p>

        <p>Structural tags, such as article, section, aside, nav, ul, li, p, and div all create blocks on the page, but
            you should use one that helps provide context and meaning for the content inside that element. All of these
            elements can be styled to look any way you want them to look. So it's not about how they look, but the
            structure of the document and the content they hold.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>What About the Almighty Div?</h3>
            <p>A div element adds no structural value to the content. It is just a generic block element that doesn't
                add any meaning. Avoid them if you can possibly use an element that makes more senes. For example, this
                div could perhaps be an aside element, since it is separate, but related content.</p>

            <p>Also, notice how the indenting changed for the content inside this div.</p>
        </div>

        <footer>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Notice the content on this page has been marked up for meaning, not for the way it displays in the
                browser. Keep the structure of your documents simple and the indenting correct. Use semantic markup
                wherever possible.</p>

            <p>Add a link to the bottom of your HTML file so you can quickly and easily validate the HTML. Note that
                this link will only work for pages that are up on the internet. It won't work if you open the html file
                directly from your desktop and click the link</p>
